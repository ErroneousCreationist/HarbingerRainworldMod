    "description": "Adds a new work in progress campaign to the game. You play as the Harbinger, a strange slugcat sent on a very special mission.\n You start in the Eastern Boundary, a distant, abandoned urban area infested with worm grass and centipedes. \n The mod is somewhat close to being done, the slugcat itself is pretty done, art is missing a few things, region isn't finished, campaign and endings also aren't done. Expect more updates and have fun!",
